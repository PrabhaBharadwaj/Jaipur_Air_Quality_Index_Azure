JAIPUR'S Air Quality Index Problem:

https://github.com/krishnaik06/Google-Cloud-Platform-Deployment

To Understand Google Cloud Platform deployment, i have downloaded already built project folder from Krish naik Github
So actual pytho code i dont have. I have Krish already created .pkl file, app.yaml , main.py, requirement.txt , templates, static
Just i did deployment by syncing this in my github

Approach:

By using Linear RandomForset Regressor , we are predicting the JAIPUR'S Air Quality Index based on user input data

Here we used Flask web application Framework and deployed in GCP (Infrastructure As A service-IAAS)
