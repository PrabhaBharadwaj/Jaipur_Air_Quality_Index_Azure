# Jaipur_Air_Quality_Index_Azure_Deply
Jaipur Air Quality index Azure deploy
For Azure Deploy we use this Github folder,Github not used for GCP deploy there we did via Google platform SDK

## JAIPUR'S Air Quality Index Problem:

https://github.com/krishnaik06/Google-Cloud-Platform-Deployment

To Understand Azure deployment, i have downloaded already built project folder from Krish naik Github
So actual python code i dont have. I have Krish already created .pkl file, app.yaml , main.py, requirement.txt , templates, static
Just i did deployment by syncing this in my github

## Approach:

By using Linear RandomForset Regressor , we are predicting the JAIPUR'S Air Quality Index based on user input data

Here we used Flask web application Framework and deployed in Azure (Infrastructure As A service-IAAS) using Github Repository.
Here we didnt use GitHub

## Here main files are :
		main.py
		app.yaml
		requirements.txt
		randomForestRegressor.pkl
    Static folder with style 
    templates folder with home
